## Statistical Analyses
- **Binomial Testing:** Used for the tasks with a clear chance level.
- **Permutation Testing:** Used for tasks where chance levels are not clearly defined.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Performed in addition to binomial testing due to the small number of trials we had, to ensure more reliable statistical inference.
